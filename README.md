An AI-powered tool that utilizes Playwright MCP to scrape, parse, and analyze real estate rental data for a given area.

This repository contains an automated real estate rent analyzer that helps you gather rental listings in specific area based on user criteria. (Currently only works with Redfin)

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Automated Web Scraping:** Extracts real estate listings from the web using Playwright.
*   **Intelligent Content Parsing:** Structures the scraped data for analysis directly to the terminal or saves it as a CSV file.
*   **AI-Powered Filtering:** Leverages AI and Playwright MCP to apply filters based on user criteria. 
*   **Dual Interface:** Can be run as a command-line tool for direct analysis or as a FastAPI server for API access.

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+ (3.11 recommended)
*   Node.js and npm (for running Playwright MCP with `npx`)

These installation steps are for Windows, and the commands provided are for PowerShell.

### üíª Installation

    ```powershell
    git clone https://github.com/eren123danyel/real-estate-analyzer.git
    cd real-estate-analyzer
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```powershell
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```powershell
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Install the spaCy English model:**

    python -m playwright install
    # Or, if you encounter issues, you can use the Node tooling:
    # npx playwright install
    ```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

This project uses `python-dotenv` to manage environment variables.

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
2.  Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:

    ```text
    OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR-API-KEY"    # Your OpenAI key
    ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running the Application

You can run this tool as a command-line application or as a web server with an API.

### As a CLI Tool

To get started directly from your terminal:

```powershell
python rentanalyzer.py --help
```

#### Sample commands
Find rentals in LA and print to terminal:
```powershell
python rentanalyzer.py -l "Los Angeles" 
```

Find rentals in New York City under 3k and save as CSV:
```powershell
python rentanalyzer.py -l "NYC" -m 3000 -o "output.csv" 
```

Find apartments under $3k that have 2+ beds and are dog friendly in Seattle and save as CSV:
```powershell
python rentanalyzer.py -g "Find apartments in Seattle that have 2+ beds and that are dog friendly and under $3k" -o "output.csv" 
```

### As an API Server

To start the FastAPI server:

```powershell
python rentanalyzer.py -api
```
The API will then be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

When run as a server, two endpoints will be made available:
 - /search_redfin_with_ai
	 - Takes parameter *goal* in natural language, which lets the AI know what to scrape.
 - /search_redfin
	 - Takes *location* and optionally *max_price*.
